# Automated Workflows Configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**
**These automated workflows are RECOMMENDATIONS based on security best practices. The specific configurations and Blockaid platform integration details are my suggestions, not real deployed workflows.**

## Overview

This section defines 8 comprehensive automated workflows that respond to the 30 detection rules. Each workflow handles multiple related detection rules and provides structured, actionable responses based on threat severity and type.
