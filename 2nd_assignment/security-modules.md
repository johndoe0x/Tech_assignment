# Security Modules Configuration

## Overview

This section covers the configuration of Blockaid's Security Modules for USDC monitoring. These modules provide proactive prevention mechanisms that complement the detection rules and workflows.

## Module Strategy

### Recommended Approach for USDC

Given USDC's global usage pattern, the security module strategy focuses on **controllable points** rather than attempting to block all network activity.

```yaml
Strategy: "Protect What You Can Control"
Focus Areas:
  1. Circle's own infrastructure
  2. Partner integrations (voluntary)
  3. Critical operational flows
  4. Emergency response capabilities
```

## 1. Cosigner Integration

### 1.1 Target Configuration

```yaml
Module: Cosigner
Target: Circle Treasury Multisig
Configuration:
  - Required Signer Mode: Enabled
  - Validation Rules:
    1. Reject any transaction calling USDC admin functions
    2. Reject transfers to addresses labeled "suspicious"
    3. Require manual approval for:
       - Proxy upgrades
       - Role transfers
       - Minting >$5M
    4. Auto-approve routine operations under thresholds
```

### 1.2 Controlled Wallets

**Primary Targets:**
- Circle Treasury wallets
- Operational multisigs
- MasterMinter controller wallets
- Upgrade admin wallets

**Configuration per Wallet:**
```yaml
Treasury Wallets:
  - Block all USDC admin functions
  - Require manual approval for large transfers (>$10M)
  - Auto-approve routine operational transactions
  - Emergency pause capability

Operational Multisigs:
  - Allow minting operations within limits
  - Block role management functions
  - Require approval for new minter additions
  - Monitor allowance changes

Controller Wallets:
  - Allow controller-specific functions only
  - Block direct admin operations
  - Monitor minter configuration changes
  - Enforce daily/weekly limits

Admin Wallets:
  - Require manual approval for all operations
  - Multi-signature validation
  - Time-locked operations for upgrades
  - Emergency override capability
```

### 1.3 Rule-Based Validation

**Critical Rules:**
```yaml
1. Proxy Function Blocking:
   - upgradeTo(): Always block, require manual approval
   - upgradeToAndCall(): Always block, require manual approval
   - changeAdmin(): Always block, require manual approval

2. Role Change Validation:
   - transferOwnership(): Block if new owner not in approved list
   - updateMasterMinter(): Validate against approved addresses
   - updatePauser(): Require manual approval
   - updateBlacklister(): Require manual approval
   - updateRescuer(): Require manual approval

3. Minting Limits:
   - mint(): Block if amount > $5M without approval
   - configureMinter(): Block if allowance > $50M
   - incrementMinterAllowance(): Block if increment > $25M

4. Emergency Functions:
   - pause(): Allow but log and alert
   - blacklist(): Require manual approval for new addresses
   - rescueERC20(): Require manual approval for amounts > $100K
```

### 1.4 Approval Workflows

**Manual Approval Process:**
```yaml
Approval Levels:
  Level 1 (Operations Team):
    - Routine minting operations
    - Controller configurations
    - Small allowance changes (<$10M)
  
  Level 2 (Security Team):
    - Role changes
    - Large minting operations
    - Emergency functions
    - Blacklist operations
  
  Level 3 (Executive Team):
    - Proxy upgrades
    - Ownership transfers
    - Major role changes
    - Emergency pause operations

Approval Timeouts:
  - Level 1: 1 hour timeout
  - Level 2: 4 hour timeout
  - Level 3: 24 hour timeout
  - Emergency override: Available for critical operations
```

## 2. Transaction Scanning Integration

### 2.1 Integration Points

**Circle-Controlled Platforms:**
```yaml
Integration Targets:
  - Circle's own platforms/wallets
  - Partner integrations (exchanges that opt-in)
  - Circle's operational tools
  - Treasury management systems

Cannot Control:
  - Third-party wallets and dApps
  - Decentralized exchanges
  - Individual user wallets
  - Cross-chain bridges (external)
```

### 2.2 Scanning Configuration

**Pre-Transaction Scanning:**
```yaml
Scan Triggers:
  - All transactions from Circle wallets
  - Large value transfers (>$1M)
  - Transactions to/from flagged addresses
  - Multi-signature operations
  - Cross-chain transactions

Scan Checks:
  - Destination address reputation
  - Transaction amount validation
  - Pattern analysis (velocity, frequency)
  - Blacklist verification
  - Compliance checks
```

**Post-Transaction Analysis:**
```yaml
Analysis Types:
  - Transaction success/failure analysis
  - Gas usage patterns
  - Behavioral analysis
  - Anomaly detection
  - Compliance reporting
```

### 2.3 Partner Integration

**Exchange Partners:**
```yaml
Voluntary Integration:
  - Coinbase
  - Binance
  - Kraken
  - Gemini
  - Other major exchanges

Integration Benefits:
  - Real-time threat intelligence sharing
  - Coordinated response to incidents
  - Shared blacklist management
  - Emergency coordination
```


## 4. Address Scanning API

### 4.1 Address Reputation

**Real-time Address Scanning:**
```yaml
Scan Types:
  - Wallet address reputation
  - Contract address verification
  - Historical transaction analysis
  - Risk scoring
  - Compliance status
```

### 4.2 Integration with Workflows

**Workflow Integration:**
```yaml
Automated Scanning:
  - All addresses in minting operations
  - New role addresses
  - Rescue operation addresses
  - Large transfer recipients
  - Blacklist candidates

Scoring System:
  - 0-25: Low risk (auto-approve)
  - 26-50: Medium risk (monitoring)
  - 51-75: High risk (manual review)
  - 76-100: Critical risk (block/investigate)
```

## 6. Limitations and Alternatives

### 6.1 What Cannot Be Controlled

**Network-Level Limitations:**
```yaml
Cannot Block:
  - Transactions at RPC level (not feasible globally)
  - Third-party wallet operations
  - Decentralized exchange trades
  - Individual user transfers
  - Cross-chain bridge operations
```

### 6.2 Alternative Approaches

**Detection and Response Focus:**
```yaml
Alternative Strategy:
  1. Ultra-fast detection (using Detection Rules)
  2. Automated alerts to ecosystem partners
  3. Rapid response procedures
  4. Post-incident recovery plans
  5. Social and legal response coordination
```

### 6.3 Ecosystem Coordination

**Industry Coordination:**
```yaml
Coordination Points:
  - Security alerts to major platforms
  - Legal action against malicious actors
  - Industry standard development
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Public security awareness
```
