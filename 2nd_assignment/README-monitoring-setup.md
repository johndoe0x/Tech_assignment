# USDC Security Monitoring Configuration on Blockaid Platform

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive security monitoring recommendations for Circle's USDC stablecoin (0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) using the Blockaid platform. The configuration leverages Blockaid's detection rule, automated workflows, and security modules to protect against privileged access abuse, proxy implementation risks, and role-based function exploitation.

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Structure

This monitoring setup guide is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **[Inventory Configuration](./inventory-configuration.md)**
- Asset onboarding and tagging
- ABI and source code handling
- Contract relationship mapping

### 2. **[Detection Rules](./detection-rules.md)**
- Critical invariants monitoring
- Privileged function monitoring (30 rules)
- Role-based access control detection
- Advanced threat detection patterns

### 3. **[Automated Workflows](./automated-workflows.md)**
- Critical infrastructure protection workflows
- Role management security workflows
- Minting security workflows
- Emergency response workflows
- Advanced threat response workflows
- Compliance workflows

### 4. **[Security Modules](./security-modules.md)**
- Cosigner integration
- Transaction scanning

## Key Objectives

This monitoring configuration addresses Circle's three main security concerns:

1. **Privileged Access Monitoring** - Comprehensive coverage of all 8 privileged roles
2. **Proxy Implementation Upgrade Risks** - Critical detection and response for proxy changes
3. **Role-based Function Abuse** - Advanced pattern detection and automated responses

## ðŸ”§ Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Start with [Inventory Configuration](./inventory-configuration.md)
2. **Detection**: Configure [Detection Rules](./detection-rules.md) (30 rules covering all threats)
3. **Response**: Implement [Automated Workflows](./automated-workflows.md) (8 comprehensive workflows)
4. **Security**: Deploy [Security Modules](./security-modules.md) for prevention


## ðŸ“Š Coverage Summary

- **Detection Rules**: 30 rules covering all privileged functions
- **Workflows**: 8 comprehensive response workflows
- **Privileged Roles**: 8 roles monitored (Admin, Owner, Master Minter, Minters, Pauser, Blacklister, Rescuer, Controllers)
- **Security Modules**: Cosigner, Transaction Scanning, Token Scanning
- **Threat Vectors**: Proxy upgrades, role abuse, minting anomalies, emergency function misuse
