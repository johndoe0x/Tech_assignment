Dear Client,

I’ve reviewed the issues you’re facing and would like to introduce two Blockaid solutions that can help resolve them:

1. Transaction Scanning API
2. DApp Scanning API

The Transaction Scanning API analyzes every signing activity in real time. It alerts your web3 product, which is integrated with this API, whenever a potentially dangerous transaction is detected.

This directly addresses your pain point—unlimited approval transactions unknowingly signed by users. The API detects such activity and provides clear, informative warnings.

This level of transparency helps users understand the risk more clearly and discourages them from proceeding with unsafe actions.

The DApp Scanning API proactively identifies risky websites such as phishing sites or fake airdrop pages. Once such a site is detected, it is recorded in our threat database. If a user clicks a malicious link, the wallet is immediately blocked from proceeding, and a warning diplayed.

This service has a strong track record in preventing real-world attacks, such as the Kevin Rose wallet drain and the Ledger Connect Kit hack—both of which were blocked hours before the attackers went live. Your users could have been protected before any damage occurred.

Both services are highly scalable and powered by our simulation engine, which models transactions and shows the expected outcomes before execution. This gives users confidence when deciding whether to approve a transaction.

Together, these two solutions create a layered defense. Most malicious sites are blocked before users can even interact with them. If a user does get through, Transaction Scanning serves as the final check before a signature is made.

Integration is simple: both products are REST APIs that can be easily integrated into your existing wallet infrastructure.

Let me know if you’d like to see a demo tailored to your current setup.

Best regards,
Devan.
